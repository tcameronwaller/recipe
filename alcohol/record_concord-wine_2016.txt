Alcohol Batch Record
Concord Wine 2016
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
15 December 2018

----------

The flavor of the wine mellowed dramatically. It tasted much less acidic, more smooth, and had more balance.

--------------------------------------------------
22 October 2017

----------
Bottle

I sealed the wine in 31 clean bottles, each of 750 milliliters capacity.

----------
Sulfite

I will add enough metabisulfite for 25 mg/L of sulfite.
To 27 liters of wine (the volume in the main fermenter), I will add 2.2 grams (4 x 0.55 grams) of potassium metabisulfite.
That addition is theoretically sufficient to impart about 40 mg/L of sulfite to the wine.

----------
Taste

The wine had a very pleasant aroma and flavor.
The taste was very mild.

----------
Rack

I transferred the wine by siphon, avoiding the majority of sediment.
After the transfer, about 27 liters of wine remained.

----------
pH

I never added sodium bicarbonate to the main batch of wine.

--------------------------------------------------
25 June 2017

----------
pH

I added about 0.5 grams (about 0.42 milliliters, 1/12 teaspoon) of sodium bicarbonate to 1 liter of wine.
The aroma and flavor of the wine seemed more mild and less caustic that it did originally.

I anticipate adding 0.5 g/L of sodium bicarbonate to the entire batch of 2016 Concord wine.

----------
Sodium Bicarbonate Measurement

A volume of 250 milliliters of sodium bicarbonate has a mass of 320 grams.
250 mL = 320 g
1.28 g/mL

--------------------------------------------------
30 May 2017

----------
pH

I measured the pH of the wine on a meter of current calibration and reliable accuracy.
The initial pH of the wine was 3.488.

To 500 milliliters of wine, I added 0.5 grams of sodium bicarbonate.
The final pH of the wine after addition of the sodium bicarbonate was 3.842.

--------------------------------------------------
6 May 2017

----------
Taste

The wine had a very pleasant aroma and flavor.
The taste was very mild.

----------
Rack

I transferred the wine by siphon, avoiding the majority of sediment.
After the transfer, about 30 liters of wine remained.
I transferred 1.5 liters of the wine to bottles for early consumption.
The remaining 28.5 liters of wine I stored for further settlement and maturation.

----------
Sulfite

On 19 March 2017, I added 7.15 grams of potassium metabisulfite (13 tablets at 0.55 grams per tablet) to about 40 liters of must.
That addition is theoretically sufficient for about 100 milligrams of sulfite per liter (mg/L).
Refer to my calculations in general notes on 26 February 2017.
As this addition was to must with an abundance of sugars and other chemicals, I expect that a lot of this sulfite reacted with chemicals in the must.

It is reasonable that the concentration of sulfite in the wine has decreased considerably since 19 March 2017.
It is also likely that 1 or more months of time will pass before I transfer the wine to bottles.
I will add enough metabisulfite for 25 mg/L of sulfite.
To 27 liters of wine (the volume in the main fermenter), I will add 1.1 grams of potassium metabisulfite.
That addition is theoretically sufficient to impart about 23 mg/L of sulfite to the wine.

----------
Measurement

I measured the specific gravity and pH of the wine.

Specific Gravity
0.988 at about 20 degrees Celsius
0.990 with correction for temperature

pH
3.6

On 19 March 2017, the specific gravity of the must was about 1.095 (1.085-1.100) grams per milliliter (g/mL).
That specific gravity corresponds to 12.4 percent potential alcohol by volume.
Today, the specific gravity of the wine was 0.990 g/mL.
That specific gravity corresponds to -1.3 percent potential alcohol by volume.
The total potential alcohol in the wine is 13.7 (12.4 - (-1.3)) percent potential alcohol by volume.

Ingredients

Potassium Metabisulfite: 0.55 gram tablets, LD Carlson

--------------------------------------------------
27 March 2017

The temperature of the room around the must was 15 degrees Celsius.
The must was bubbling actively.

--------------------------------------------------
26 March 2017

The temperature of the room around the must was 19 degrees Celsius.
The must was bubbling actively.

I removed large solid material from the wine.
The total volume of wine was about 35 liters.
I transferred 28 liters of the wine to a glass fermenter and transferred the remainder to plastic bottles.

--------------------------------------------------
25 March 2017

The temperature of the room around the must was 12 degrees Celsius.
The must was bubbling less actively than before.

--------------------------------------------------
24 March 2017

The temperature of the room around the must was 10 degrees Celsius.
The must was bubbling less actively than before.

--------------------------------------------------
23 March 2017

The temperature of the room around the must was 13 degrees Celsius.
The must was bubbling audibly.

I collected 50 milliliters (container 1: 30 ml, container 2: 20 mL) of the wine must.
I measured the pH of this must on a digital pH meter.
The pH measurement was 3.30.
This measurement might not be very reliable because fermentation was very active in the must at the time of measurement.
Carbon dioxide from fermentation might have interfered with the measurement.

It is common for the pH of the must to decrease during fermentation.
The pH of the must might increase after fermentation.

Plan to measure the pH of the wine after fermentation and also after any dilution by addition of water.

As the wine will be dry with very little residual sugar, I do not want the wine to be too tart.
I want a pH around 3.7, the maximal value for typical red wine.

----------
Procedure

I sprinkled 10 grams (container 1: 5 grams, container 2: 5 grams) of yeast on the surface of the wine must.

At the time of innoculation, the must was in a room with a temperature of 16 degrees Celsius.
I covered the must in the bucket losely with a lid.
I allowed the must to rest at 15-20 degrees Celsius for 5 days.

----------
Ingredients

Yeast: Premier Blanc Champagne Yeast, expiration date January 2019, Red Star

----------
Notes

Wine yeast can survive temperatures of 4-37 degrees Celsius (40-100 degrees Fahrenheit).
Cooler fermentation temperatures of 4-20 degrees Celsius (40-70 degrees Fahrenheit) decrease the rate of fermentation and preserve aromatic components in the wine.
Cooler fermentation temperatures are ideal for fruity white wines.
Warmer fermentation temperatures of 10-27 degrees Celsius (50-80 degrees Fahrenheit) increase the rate of fermentation and might enhance extraction of pigments and tannins.
Warmer temperatures are ideal for red wines.

Even for a red wine with full flavor, cooler fermentation temperatures are better for Concord grapes.
The cooler temperatures will reduce extraction of unpleasant aromas and flavors from the grapes' skins.

----------
Plan

To avoid over-dilution of wine, and to limit the volume of must in primary fermentation, do not add any water for dilution of the must until transfer to secondary fermenter.
At this stage, add water to fill fermenter to its top.

To balance color and flavor extraction while avoiding excessive muskiness from Concord grapes, remove skins and pulp from the must after about 3 days, a little earlier than the typical 5-7 days.

----------
Procedure

Must, Grapes
I removed grapes from storage at -20 degrees Celsius.
I allowed grapes to thaw gradually, avoiding raising them to a temperature greater than about 37 degrees Celsius.
I transferred grapes to a clean, food-grade, plastic bucket, my primary fermenter.
I crushed grapes thoroughly using a clean piece of wood.

Must, Additions

I added 12 liters (3 gallons) of Concord Grape Juice to increase the volume of must to about 38 liters (10 gallons).

I added 30 grams (10 teaspoons) of pectinase (pectic enzyme) to the must.
This dose of pectinase was double the manufacturer's recommendation.

For juice, about 1.5 pounds sugar.
For grapes, about 2-10 pounds sugar.
Start with 4 pounds sugar.

I added 5.125 kilograms (container 1: 2.875, container 2: 2.250) of sugar to the must, until the specific gravity of the must was about 1.095 (1.085-1.100) grams per milliliter.
Initial specific gravity of the must with grape juice was 1.043 g/mL.
Final specific gravity of the must was 1.099 g/mL (container 1: 1.098, container 2: 1.100).
At time of measurement, the temperature of the must was 64 +/- 5 degrees Fahrenheit (container 1: 59, container 2: 69).

I added 0 grams of sodium bicarbonate to the must, until the pH of the must was about pH 3.5 (3.4-3.7).
Initial measurement of pH (using test strips) was 3.6.

I added 7.15 grams of potassium metabisulfite (13 tablets at 0.55 grams per tablet) to the must.
The goal concentration of sulfite for wine must (as I calculated in general notes on 26 February 2017) is 75 milligrams per liter (mg/l).
For this goal concentration, the dosage is 1.375 grams per 10 liters, or about 5.5 grams for 40 liters.
I used an excessive dose, but not unreasonably so.

Sterilization
I covered the must in the bucket losely with a lid.
I allowed the must to incubate at 20-25 degrees Celsius for 24 hours.

----------
Ingredients

Concord Grape Juice: Concord Grape Juice Beverage ("filtered water, concord grape juice, cane sugar, grape juice (for color), citric acid (for tartness), natural flavor"), Welch's
Pectinase (Pectic Enzyme): 75 units/gram, North Mountain Supply
Potassium Metabisulfite: 0.55 gram tablets, LD Carlson

----------

From harvest in 2016, I have approximately 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of Concord Grapes.
In order to make a wine with moderate to full body and flavor, 25 kilograms of Concord Grapes is sufficient for 17-24 liters of wine.
The capacity of my secondary fermenter is about 27 liters.
As it is unfavorable to leave air space in the secondary fermenter, I will use Concord grape juice from concentrate to fill surplus space in the fermenter.
I might need up to 10 liters of supplemental Concord grape juice.

Wines that are more acidic generally require more sugar so that the sweetness can moderate the acidity.
Wines that are less acidic can be more dry.

Harvest

On 11 September 2016, I harvested Concord grapes from the vines on the fence in our back yard. On 11 and 12 September 2016, I removed these grapes from the vines. Then I washed them in water. I placed 2.5 kilograms of grapes in plastic bags and stored them in the freezer at about -20 degrees Celsius. I prepared 10 bags of grapes. That means that I harvested, prepared, and stored 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of grapes!
