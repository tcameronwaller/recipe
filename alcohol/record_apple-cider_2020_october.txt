Critique

- how is the sweetness level?
- how is the hops level?

6 December 2020

Priming sugar
I added 0.5 cup of granulated sugar, which ought to have a mass of approximately 100 grams. This amount of sugar in about 10 liters of cider ought to allow carbonation to about 3.5 bars of pressure (about 35 liters of carbon dioxide).

Bottling
I siphoned the cider into bottles and capped them.

29 November 2020

Back sweeten
I added approximately 150 grams of erythritol crystals (with Monk Fruit extract) (0.75 cups of crystals) to the 10 liters of cider.

Mass 800 grams of erythritol crystals measure 4 cups in volume.

26 November 2020

Secondary rack
I siphoned the cider to a clean stainless steel pot, cleaned the carboy, then siphoned the cider back to the clean carboy.

I tasted the cider, and the amount of erythritol back sweetener was about right.

I crushed and added 0.55 grams (1 Campden tablets) to the cider.

22 November 2020

Back sweeten

I added approximately 300 grams of erythritol crystals to the 10 liters of cider.

13 November 2020

Primary rack
I siphoned the cider to a clean stainless steel pot, cleaned the carboy, then siphoned the cider back to the clean carboy. I took care to avoid transferring most of the lees and hops sediment.

Specific gravity
I measured the specific gravity while the cider was at a temperature of about 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit): 0.992. After temperature adjustment, the specific gravity was about 0.993.

4 November 2020

Make: Northern Brewer
Variety: UK Fuggle
Alpha acid: 5.2%
Aroma: "Pleasant mint, grassy, floral"
Typical beer styles: "English Ale"
Mass: 56.6 grams (2 ounces)

At 19:00, I added 56.6 grams of pellet Fuggle hops from the United Kingdom to the 3 gallons of cider. The cider had enough carbon dioxide in solution that the particulate material triggered a slight eruption. This eruption wasted approximately 500 mL of cider and a fourth of the hops. With occasional stirring, the remaining hop particulate settled after a few days.

22 October 2020

Since starting fermentation on 19 October 2020, the cider has been at a temperature of 18 degrees Celsius.

At 07:45, the rate of bubbles was 103 per minute.
I counted major, distinguishable air expulsions as 1 bubble over the course of 3 minutes.

I noticed that rapid fermentation expels larger volumes of air simultaneously. When the rate of bubbles is 100 per minute, each expulsion includes 2 or 3 bubbles. During slower fermentation, these bubbles I would count these bubbles separately because they would expel with more separation.

A more accurate measure of fermentation rate would use the actual volume of carbon dioxide in an inverted graduated cylinder filled with water.

--------------------------------------------------
19 October 2020

I measured the specific gravity. The temperature of the cider was approximately 18 degrees Celsius (64 degrees Fahrenheit), and the raw measurement on the hydrometer was 1.074. After temperature correction, the specific gravity was 1.075. This was the initial specific gravity before fermentation. This specific gravity corresponds to potential alcohol of 9.8 % from complete fermentation.

At 10:00, I sprinkled 5 grams of Premier Blanc by Red Star champagne yeast on top of the cider in the glass carboy. I then attached a bung and air lock.

Reference

Refer to general fermentation notes ("note_fermentation.txt") from 29 September 2020 for general notes and calculations.

----------
Goal

volume: 10 liters
alcohol concentration: 9 % by volume
initial sugar concentration: 209 grams per liter
initial specific gravity (relative to water): 1.070

----------
Sugar addition

I purchased 3 gallons of fresh, pasteurized apple cider by River Ridge Produce in Sparta Michigan. The label claims that there are 26 grams of natural sugar per 240 milliliters. This hypothetical amount of sugar converts to 108 grams per liter.

From my apple cider batch that I started in September 2020, I knew that the actual density of this cider was about 1.052.

I added 3.5 cups of granulated organic cane sugar.

I combined the sugar with about 2 gallons of cider and mixed periodically until sugar dissolved. Then I filled the carboy with remaining volume of cider.

----------
Acid blend

I added 0.75 teaspoon of acid blend to the cider. I used a crystalline blend of citric, malic, and tartaric acid by LD Carlson.

----------
Potassium metabisulfite (Campden) addition

Refer to general fermentation notes and calculations on 26 February 2017.

For a final concentration of about 60 mg/l of free sulfites in solution, I added 1.1 grams (2 Campden tablets) of potassium metabisulfite to the 10 liters of cider. As the cider is much simpler than a raw must, I think this concentration ought to suffice. Plan to add more metabisulfite to a target concentration of 30 mg/l after fermentation and before bottling.
