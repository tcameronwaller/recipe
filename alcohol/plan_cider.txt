notes and plans for future batches of cider


- equipment
-- longer siphon tube: 9 feet
-- longer, simpler racking cane in stainless steel

- apple base
-- use apple juice concentrate to enhance the apple flavor and aromas
-- dilute concentrate from 9 gallons of apple juice to a volume of 6 gallons

- sugar addition
-- use dark brown sugar for all sugar additions

- alcohol content
-- 9 %v/v alcohol is about right

- adjuncts
-- Fuggle hops
--- add long after fermentation has completed and carbonation has settled
--- use half the quantity as in the October 2020 batch
-- oak cubes
-- coriander

- back sweetener
-- decrease the amount of erythritol sweetener from batches of September and October 2020
--- use only erythritol without Monk fruit
-- or consider Stevia
--- Calvyn Van Zyl uses 150 grams Stevia in 5 gallons of cider
--- several other cider makers say that Stevia introduces bad flavors
