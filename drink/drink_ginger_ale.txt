I consulted several recipes for ginger ale. These recipes came from 
these sources.
Alton Brown. "Ginger Ale". Food Network. www.foodnetwork.com.
"Natural Ginger Ale". Welness Mama. www.welnessmama.com.
Emma Christensen. "Soda Recipe: Homemade Ginger Ale". True Brews. The Kitchn. www.thekitchn.com.
-Emma recommends a minimum of 1 tablespoon sugar to carbonate 2 litres of solution.
I developed this recipe in multiple trials.
I began development of this recipe in May 2016.

-------------------------
Volume: 2 litres
-------------------------

Ingredients
Water: 2 litres
Lemon juice: 0.25 cup
Sugar, raw: 7 tablespoons
Ginger, fresh, finely-sliced: 50 grams
Salt, without iodine: 0.125 teaspoon
Yeast, champagne: 0.125 teaspoon
Optional
Red Rooibos: Steep 2 teaspoons with ginger for 5 minutes to give solution an aesthetic red color.

Procedure
Stew and steep ginger in about 2 litres of the water for about 30 minutes. Combine remaining ingredients except yeast to water and allow to dissolve. Add remaining water. Allow slurry to cool to about 25 degrees Celsius. Strain slurry to remove ginger pulp. Add yeast to solution. Seal solution in bottles. Incubate solution at about 25 degrees Celsius for 1 - 5 days until the pressure in the bottle is about as high as it can get without breaking the bottle. Store the solution at 4 degrees Celsius for up to 2 weeks before drinking.

Record

13 July 2020

I used 0.5-0.75 cup lemon juice from 3 lemons. I used 0.33 cup (5 tablespoons) white granular sugar. I used 0.125 teaspoon salt with iodine (oops). I used approximately 4 inches of frozen ginger root that had a medium thickness. I used Premier Blanc champagne yeast. I diluted the mixture with water to a total volume of 2 liters. I did not steep the ginger in hot water. Rather I chopped the ginger and added it to the bottles before pouring the other ingredients in the bottles. The fermentation was robust, with strong carbonation after 24-48 hours. The ale had a pleasantly strong taste of raw ginger. The lemon was almost too strong. It might be good to decrease the sugar further, though only slightly. I recommend pulverizing the ginger after chopping. I also think it would be fun to allow the ale to ferment to completion to produce some alcohol. Then add enough sugar to back sweeten and prime for subsequent carbonation.

4 May 2016

The batch from 1 May 2016 incubated at 70 - 80 degrees Fahrenheit from about 20:00 on 1 May 2016 to about 20:00 on 4 May 2016. At that point the bottles hardly bent inward when I squeezed them with reasonable pressure.

The carbonation was good enough. The ginger was plenty hot enough. The sweetness was not enough. Next time use 7 tablespoons of sugar. I also do not think that the rooibos was necessary. Maybe a little more lemon would be good. I am not sure if the more lemon is a good idea or not.

1 May 2016

Here are the ingredients that I used in the batch of 1 May 2016.

Ingredients
Water: 2 litres
Lemon juice: 0.25 cup
Sugar, raw: 5 tablespoons
Ginger, fresh, finely-sliced: 50 grams
Salt, without iodine: 0.125 teaspoon
Yeast, champagne: 0.125 teaspoon... I used Premier Blanc by Red Star
Optional
Red Rooibos: Steep 2 teaspoons with ginger for 5 minutes to give solution an aesthetic red color.

I would prefer stronger ginger flavor. Consider using more ginger (75 g) next time. To my taste, 0.25 cup of lemon juice is enough for a gentle lemon taste. I worry that more lemon juice would over-power the ginger. I wonder if 0.25 teaspoon of salt would be better than the 0.125 teaspoon that I used. To my taste 0.125 teaspoon of salt is enough. I am also concerned that the sweetness will be too low after the yeast digest some of the sugar for carbonation. To my taste and Rosalie's taste, 5 tablespoons of sugar is enough.
