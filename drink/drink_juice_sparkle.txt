I began development of this recipe in December 2018.

-------------------------
Volume: 2.5 litres
-------------------------

Ingredients
Juice: 2.5 litres
Yeast, champagne: 0.125 teaspoon

Procedure
Bring temperature of juice to about 15-25 degrees Celsius. Add yeast to juice. Shake to suspend yeast evenly throughout juice. Transfer suspension to bottles. Seal bottles. Incubate solution at about 25 degrees Celsius for 12 - 48 hours until the pressure in flexible plastic bottle(s) is high enough that it is difficult to dent the bottle when squeezing by hand. Store the soda at 4 degrees Celsius for up to 2 weeks before drinking. Allow yeast to settle to bottom of bottle before pouring.

Notes

Juice

It is preferrable to use fruit juice, maybe from concentrate, without addition of extra sugar.

Yeast

It is preferrable to use champagne yeast rather than baking yeast.

Bottles

If sealing soda in glass bottles, then also seal a portion of the same suspension at the same time in a plastic bottle. Check the developing pressure in the plastic bottle.

With complete fermentation, 16.83 grams of sugar per liter sustains production of 1 % ethanol by volume.

After ___ hours, the plastic bottle with grape soda was very firm. I transferred the bottles of grape soda to storage at 4 degrees Celsius.

After ___ hours, the plastic bottle with apple soda was very firm. I transferred the bottles of grape soda to storage at 4 degrees Celsius.

White grape juice had 36 grams of sugar per 240 milliliters (https://www.simpletruth.com/products/white-grape-100-juice/).

Apple juice had 26 grams of sugar per 240 milliliters (https://www.kroger.com/p/kroger-no-sugar-added-100-apple-juice/0001111082114).

I used Premier Blanc Champagne Yeast by Red Star with an expiration date of January 2019.

In about 3.79 liters of apple juice, I suspended 0.25 teaspoon of yeast.

In about 3.79 liters of grape juice, I suspended 0.25 teaspoon of yeast.

The yeast in the grape juice began producing gas bubbles much more quickly than it did in the apple juice.

I transferred and sealed the apple juice in 3 glass bottles of 0.75-liter capacity and 1 plastic bottle of 1-liter capacity.

I transferred and sealed the grape juice in 3 glass bottles of 0.75-liter capacity and 1 plastic bottle of 1-liter capacity.

I placed the bottles of soda in a plastic container with a lid and stored at 20 - 25 degrees Celsius.
