8 March 2016

1 cup ground whole almonds
1/3 cup rice flour
7.5 cups water
1 1/2 (1.5) teaspoon cinnamon

Combined those ingredients.
Brought to boil.
Simmered on low for 5 minutes.
Left slurry to sit for 10 hours.

9 March 2016

Stirred slurry.
Strained slurry through fine wire strainer.
Added 1 teaspoon salt.
Added 1/4 cup + 1 Tablespoon raw sugar.
That was too much sugar. Add only 1/4 cup or less.
Added 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.
Added 3.5 cups cool water to bring total volume to about 10 cups. Just start with 11 cups water next time.
Mixed slurry.

Evaluation
The recipe could handle more cinnamon to give a stronger flavor.
The recipe could handle less sugar.
The recipe is still pretty thick with 10 cups water.
The recipe could handle a total of 1.5 teaspoons salt.
The recipe might be even more awesome and frothy with carbonation.

15 cups (3.5 L) water
2 cups (400 g) sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon Champagne yeast
0.5 g yeast nutrient
Procedure
Soak rice and cinnamon in 4 cups (950 mL) of water for 3 - 48 hours. Blend slurry in a blender to break grains apart. Strain through fine strainer to remove solid chunks from slurry. Alternatively, start with rice flour.
