I consulted several recipes for yeast biscuits and
came up with my own modification.

A helpful recipe was "Fluffy Yeast Biscuits"
by Marie on Food.
www.food.com/recipe/fluffy-yeast-biscuits-66895

Another helpful recipe was "Angel Biscuits I"
by Denise on AllRecipes.
allrecipes.com/recipe/6866/angel-biscuits-i/

I began development of this recipe in June 2016.

I eventually decided that my recipe more closely resembles rich rolls than biscuits.

The dough was elastic and moist, but it was also dry enough to handle easily without much dough sticking to hands. I shaped the dough in balls that were about twice the volume of a chicken egg.

I wonder if this recipe really makes biscuits or if it is more appropriate to say that it makes moist, rich rolls.

Maybe I should just adapt my brioche bread recipe to make brioche rolls.

The dough was very moist. The dough was too moist for rolling and almost too moist to handle by hand. The dough shaped well by simply dropping portions on a baking sheet from a spoon or spatula and then patting into shape with the spoon or spatula.

The biscuits rose reasonably well. Since the dough was so moist, the biscuits spread out and did not really rise taller. I think I used a generous measurement of milk this time. Next time use a little less liquid so that the dough is slightly drier. The drier dough will probably rise better. I recommend decreasing the amount of milk or water slightly (maybe to 1.33 cup or something).

This recipe used more salt than some recipes. The biscuits did taste noticeably salty. Decrease the amount of salt.

This recipe uses less fat than some recipes. Using liquid fat (oil) limits
the amount that the dough can accomodate without being too fluid to shape
and rise.
