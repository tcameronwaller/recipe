----------
Procedure
Active Preparation Time: about 3 hours
----------

Starter
Combine ingredients for starter.
Starter will have a wet, thick consistency similar to a thick pudding.
Cover the starter in a sufficiently large container.
Let the starter rest for 12-24 hours in a warm place (about 75 degrees Fahrenheit).

Dough
Combine starter with ingredients for dough.
Add flour gradually.
Add wheat flour before white flour so that the wheat flour has a chance to soak up moisture.
Add partial amount of flour, then allow moist dough to rest for 15 minutes to allow flour to soak up moisture.
Add enough flour to form a soft dough that is only slightly sticky and holds its shape for good rise.
Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes.

Cover the dough in a sufficiently large container.
Let the dough rest and rise for about 2 hours in a warm place (about 75 degrees Fahrenheit) until it doubles in volume.

Loaves

Shape the dough into loaves of about 500 grams in mass.
Knead more flour into the dough as necessary.
Dough should be easy to handle on its surface and only slightly sticky (still possible to handle) in its core.
If dough is too moist, then bread will not rise as well.
Place loaves on a layer of cornmeal over parchment paper.
Cover loaves with plastic wrap or a towel.
Let the loaves rise for about 1 hour in a warm place (about 75 degrees Fahrenheit) until they double in volume.
Slash the tops of loaves.
Dust the tops of loaves with flour.

Bake

Heat a baking stone in an oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
Place a pan of hot water in the bottom of the oven to create steam in the oven.
Bake the loaves in the oven for 20-25 minutes.
