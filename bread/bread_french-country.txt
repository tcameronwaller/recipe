Yeild: 1 loaf

Ingredients
----------

Option 1: Blend of wheat flour and white bread flour
Option 2: White Bread flour

Starter
Water: 1 cup
Olive oil: 2 Tablespoons (optional)
Yeast: 0.25 teaspoon
Wheat gluten: 1 tablespoon (optional with good flour)
Option 1
Flour, wheat: 1.5 cups
Option 2
Flour, white: 2 cups

Dough
Sugar: 1 tablespoon (optional)
Salt: 1.5 teaspoons
Option 1
Flour, white: 0.5-1 cups
Option 2
Flour, white: 0.5-1 cups

----------
Procedure
Active Preparation Time: about 3 hours
----------

Starter
Combine ingredients for starter.
If using a blend of wheat and white flour, add wheat flour before white flour so that the wheat flour has a chance to soak up moisture and digest.
Starter will have a wet, thick consistency similar to a thick pudding.
Cover the starter in a sufficiently large container.
Let the starter rest for 12-24 hours in a warm place (about 75-120 degrees Fahrenheit).
Gluten matrix development should cause the starter to stick together.

Warm incubation (optional... alters flavor)
Place the dough in a container of about 4-6 liter capacity with a tight covering to preserve water in the dough.
Place this smaller container in or over a larger container of about 10-15 liter capacity.
Place warm water (about 75-120 degrees Fahrenheit) in this larger container to maintain incubation temperature around the dough.

Dough
Combine starter with salt and sugar.
Let the starter absorb and adjust to the salt and sugar for 1 hour in a warm place (about 75-120 degrees Fahrenheit).
Combine starter with flour for dough.
Add flour gradually.
Add partial amount of flour, then allow moist dough to rest for 15 minutes to allow flour to soak up moisture.
Add enough flour to form a soft dough that is only slightly sticky and holds its shape for good rise.

Knead
Kneading is an opportunity to mix the dough and facilitate development of the gluten matrix for the dough's structure.
Dough should be easy to handle on its surface but moist and sticky in its core.
Add just enough flour in small dustings to the table top and dough surface to keep the dough from sticking and tearing.
If dough is too moist or if the flour lacks gluten, then bread will not rise as well.
Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes.
Check gluten development by stretching the starter thin to a transparent sheet.

Incubation
Cover the dough in a sufficiently large container.
Let the dough rest and rise for about 2 hours in a warm place (about 75-120 degrees Fahrenheit) until it doubles in volume.
Check the dough's structure by how well the dough rises up relative to spreading out.

Loaves

Shape the dough into loaves of about 500 grams in mass.
Place loaves on a layer of cornmeal over parchment paper.
Cover loaves with plastic wrap or a towel.
Let the loaves rise for about 1 hour in a warm place (about 75-120 degrees Fahrenheit) until they double in volume.
Slash the tops of loaves.
Spray a light mist of water on the surface of the loaves right before baking.

Bake

Preheat oven and baking stone if you have one to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
Place a pan of hot water in the bottom of the oven to create steam in the oven.
Bake the loaves in the oven at 500 degrees Fahrenheit for the first 5 minutes of baking.
Decrease the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for 10-20 more minutes.
Bake until the bread's surface is thoroughly golden and begins to turn darker brown in small areas.
Baguettes require only 10-15 minutes to bake.
Thicker loaves require 10-30 minutes to bake.
